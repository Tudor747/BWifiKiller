BWifiKill ESP32 V4.0 is a portable suite for lab work, learning, and authorized auditing of WiFi networks, Bluetooth, and RF activity at 2.4 GHz. This version organizes the firmware into categories, improves the OLED interface, adds new passive tools, and prepares the project for installation using Web Flasher or PlatformIO.

The source interface, web pages, comments, documentation, and SVG diagrams are in English. See the [English construction and user manual](BUILD_MANUAL_EN.md) for a page-by-page translation of the original PDF's text. Original photographs, screenshots, and the illustrated PDF retain their embedded text.

The bundled `.bin` files and hosted installer still contain the original firmware. Build this local source with PlatformIO to use the English interface; cloning the upstream repository downloads its original source.

> Responsible use: some features are intended only for a controlled lab. Do not use this firmware against networks, devices, or people without explicit permission.

## Installation and flashing

### Method 1: Web Flasher

1. Open the web installer in Chrome or Edge:
   [Open BWifiKill V4.0 Web Flasher](https://pepeangell5.github.io/BWifiKill-ESP32-V4.0/)
2. Connect the ESP32 via USB.
3. Click `Install BWifiKill V4.0`.
4. Select the serial port.
5. If flashing does not start, hold `BOOT` while writing begins.

### Method 2: full binary with esptool

Use this file:

```bash
binarios/BWifiKill-ESP32-V4.0-full.bin
```

Recommended command:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 binarios/BWifiKill-ESP32-V4.0-full.bin
```

### Method 3: PlatformIO

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pepeangell5/BWifiKill-ESP32-V4.0.git
cd BWifiKill-ESP32-V4.0
pio run
pio run -t upload
```

If you use VS Code:

1. Install the PlatformIO extension.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Connect the ESP32.
4. Click `Upload`.
